# HangmanApp
This app is a simple Java app I built to help me better understand some core fundamentals of Java. 
It's a simple hangman application in which the user can guess letters to try and guess the word correctly. 
As the user guesses an incorrect letter, the hangman is filled out one by one until the hangmna figure is completed.
As the user guesses a correct letter, the word is filled in until the word is completely filled in with correct letters.
